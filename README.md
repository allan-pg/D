## Introduction
With the rise of video content, YouTube has become a valuable data source to understand online engagement patterns. In this repository I dived into gathering and analyzing data from YouTube using Python with ease. Whether you're a data analyst, developer, or curious enthusiast, this project will walk you through scraping data from the YouTube API and performing insightful analysis on it. 🎉

📌 What to expect  
1. Accessing YouTube’s API to pull in data such as video details, comments, likes, views, and more.
2. Data Processing in Python to clean and organize the data for meaningful analysis.
3. Data Visualization & Insights using libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.  

🚀 Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Python 🐍
- Some familiarity with API requests 🔑

## Project Objectives
- **Extract YouTube Data:** Use the YouTube Data API to collect relevant information such as view counts, likes, comments, and video details.
- **Data Wrangling and Data Cleaning:** Process and clean the data to ensure consistency and usability.
- **Perform Data Analysis:** Analyze metrics like viewer engagement, subscriber ccount, number of videos uploaded and trending topics.
- **Visualize Insights:** Present data findings through visualizations to convey key insights clearly.
