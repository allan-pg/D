## Introduction
With the rise of video content, YouTube has become a valuable data source to understand online engagement patterns. In this repository I dived into gathering and analyzing data from YouTube using Python with ease. Whether you're a data analyst, developer, or curious enthusiast, this project will walk you through scraping data from the YouTube API and performing insightful analysis on it. 🎉

📌 What to expect  
1. Accessing YouTube’s API to pull in data such as video details, comments, likes, views, and more.
2. Data Processing in Python to clean and organize the data for meaningful analysis.
3. Data Visualization & Insights using libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
